## Exercise 2
Exercise Description: Ask user to input two numbers. Create and initialize two Booleans. Based on Booleans value create different outputs, and different actions. If both are false add the two numbers. If at least one Boolean is false subtract the second from the first number. If 1st Boolean is false and 1st number  larger than 5 multiply the two numbers. If second Boolean is true, AND addition is larger than 45 and number1%number2 is zero then print Something.
